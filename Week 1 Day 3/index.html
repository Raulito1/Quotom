      </header>
        <p>
          I'm Raul Alvarado <br>
          Certified as a Full Stack Developer, & employed as a Frontend Developer at Quotom. <br>
          Currently in a wheelchair, due to a car accident 2 years ago. I have found it to bring the most out of me. <br>
          I feel that everything happens for a reason in life. It has brought me out of my comfort zone in many levels. <br>
          I share my testimony as a motivation to others, that life doesn't have to stop due to an unseen circumastance. <br>
          I enjoy life very much as before if not more. Ha Ha. I was a general contractor before my accident, which has now brought me <br>
          to where I am now in life, I did not want to just get another job, I wanted a career. So I got certified as a Full Stack Web Developer <br>
          from the University Of Georgia. Why Development, you might ask? Well why not? ,It's perfect for my situation, <br>
          since stumbling across this career of solving everyday world problems I feel accomplished. Especially when, others ask what do I do <br>
          and I can proudly say I am a Developer.

          Current Career : Frontend Developer for Quotom <br>
          I enjoy my new career as a Frontend developer, It takes a lot of thinking and problem solving skills. <br>
          Never a dull moment and always something new to work on. I've learned to work with a team. <br>
          Working with others is very important, Like the old saying 2 headds are better than 1. <br>
          I like to see how others think and also i can learn at the same time how others think and problem solve. <br>
          Prior to starting my career path at Quotom, I gained knowledge and hands on expeirience from attending <br>
          The University Of Georgia Full Stack Development course. It has helped me understand many concepts and Frameworks that are used in todays world. <br>
